This project contains code used to analyze financial data.

This will show you a demo of S&P 500 performance, comparing arithmetic mean and geometric mean, and then compare it to an IUL.

The output of the latest version is shown below:

IUL arithmetic performance (1951 to 2022) = 8.9%
IUL geometric performance (1951 to 2022) = 8.7%
Actual IUL total growth factor (1951 to 2022) = 402.3x

A geometric growth difference of 1.3% (8.7% over 7.3%) means that...
IUL beats S&P 500 by a factor of: 2.5x

This is where every 10, 15, 20, etc. year interval in all the data is evaluated and then averaged together.
The min and max performance of each interval is displayed, and the 1st stddev is shown. There is a 68%
that actual performance is within 1 stddev of the average.
