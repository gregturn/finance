This project contains code used to analyze financial data.

To build and run the finance.scala app:

1) Install scala (brew install scala works)
2) scalac *.scala && scala Eiul  (this ensures that compile errors break out and don't try to run anything)

This will show you a demo of S&P 500 performance, comparing arithmetic mean and geometric mean, and then compare it to an EIUL.

The output of the latest version is shown below:

  This is where every 10, 15, 20, etc. year interval in all the data is evaluated and then averaged together.
  The min and max performance of each interval is displayed, and the 1st stddev is shown. There is a 68%
  that actual performance is within 1 stddev of the average.
